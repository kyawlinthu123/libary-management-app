# Library Management App

Welcome to the Library Management App, a web application designed to help you store and manage your book collection with ease.

This is a project from an online course I signed up. I coded along with the project tutorials, and I actually understood React.js concepts really well and modified or rather, improvised the cource code a few times here and there when I'm trying out the new concepts myself.

## Features

- **Book Management:** Add, edit, and remove books from your collection.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific books using the search feature.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js (Vite):** The application is built using the modern React.js framework with Vite for efficient development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, providing a customizable and responsive design.
